# OnmyoTetris
A Japanese style tetris game

This is only a simple demo of the game to demonstrate my abilities.

1. Feeling comfortable using interface and learning new framework or libraries.
2. Module design techniques. (OOP)
3. Know how to integrate multimedia (sound, music, images) into the software.
4. Game logic design.

However, SFML is a simple graphical library that cannot be used to build industrial-level games compared to using Unity or Unreal. I simply consider this game as a way of demonstrating my knowledge and abilities in OOP design and C++ programming. 

Press P for pasuing and press it again to start. 
Click Exit for exiting the game.

The scroll on the right side was intentionally designed to display the level of the game and the circle on the bottom-left is the scoreboard (not implemented yet and I think SFML is terrile at displaying plain text). 

The Tetromino on the top-left is the next tetromino the player is going to see.
