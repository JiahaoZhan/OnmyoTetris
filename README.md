# OnmyoTetris
A Japanese style tetris game

__This is only a simple demo of the game to demonstrate my abilities.__

1. Feeling comfortable using interface and learning new framework or libraries.
2. Module design techniques. (OOP)
3. Know how to integrate multimedia (sound, music, images) into the software.
4. Game logic design.
5. The use of Visual Studio. 

However, SFML is a simple graphical library that cannot be used to build industrial-level games compared to using Unity or Unreal. I simply consider this game as a way of demonstrating my knowledge and abilities in OOP design and C++ programming. 

Press P for pasuing and press it again to start. 
Click Exit for exiting the game.

The scroll on the right side was intentionally designed to display the level of the game and the circle on the bottom-left is the scoreboard (not implemented yet and I think SFML is terrile at displaying plain text). 

The Tetromino on the top-left is the next tetromino the player is going to see.

__If you want to play this game for a minute. You can download the release folder as a whole because the dependent dynamic libraries are in the folder and execute the .exe file in it.__

__If you want to check the source code of the game just open the OnmyoTetris folder and you will see all of the header files and source files in it.__

Thanks for your review of my project!
